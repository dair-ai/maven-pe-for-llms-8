He could also just deposit it in his account and write a cheque to the business.\"I have checked with Bank of America, and they say the ONLY way to cash (or deposit, or otherwise get access to the funds represented by a check made out to my business) is to open a business account. They tell me this is a Federal regulation, and every bank will say the same thing.  To do this, I need a state-issued \"\"dba\"\" certificate (from the county clerk\\'s office) as well as an Employer ID Number (EIN) issued by the IRS. AND their CHEAPEST business banking account costs $15 / month. I think I can go to the bank that the check is drawn upon, and they will cash it, assuming I have documentation showing that I am the sole proprietor. But I\\'m not sure.... What a racket!!\"When a business asks me to make out a cheque to a person rather than the business name, I take that as a red flag. Frankly it usually means that the person doesn\\'t want the money going through their business account for some reason - probably tax evasion. I\\'m not saying you are doing that, but it is a frequent issue. If the company makes the cheque out to a person they may run the risk of being party to fraud. Worse still they only have your word for it that you actually own the company, and aren\\'t ripping off your employer by pocketing their payment. Even worse, when the company is audited and finds that cheque, the person who wrote it will have to justify and document why they made it out to you or risk being charged with embezzlement. It\\'s very much in their interests to make the cheque out to the company they did business with. Given that, you should really have an account in the name of your business. It\\'s going to make your life much simpler in the long run.'],\n",
